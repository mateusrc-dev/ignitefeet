Ignite fleet is an application created in React Native to rent cars from a fictitious company in which we can track the location of the cars on Google Maps through the user's device.

To create these features, the Google API was used, which provides the map and also ways to pin the location of the device of the person using the car.

The application also has social login using the Google API.

Libraries/libs used in the application were:

- asyncStorage - to store information on the user's device
- dayjs - to handle dates
- realm - to store data in the cloud and synchronize the cloud data with the data saved on the device
- styled-components - to create graphical interface components
- react-navigation - to create application route logic

To use the application on your machine:

- it is necessary to use an android emulator - I recommend using android studio
- with the emulator open, run the 'npm run android' command to install the application on the emulated device

Okay, if everything is ok, the application will open on the device :)
